## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

There are many great Google Dork scripts available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Google Dork script so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:

* Your time should be focused on finding information.
 
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a googling 100 searches per hand


This script is not finished yet and I am actively working on it.
 You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

## Built With

This script is made with Python and would not be possible without the amazing module 'googlesearch'
